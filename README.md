    JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
    JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
    JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id

	billing_country,
	SUM(total) AS total_expenses,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
	PARTITION BY billing_country
	ORDER BY SUM(total) DESC
	) AS rowno
  FROM customer 
  JOIN invoice on invoice.customer_id = customer.customer_id
  GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
  ORDER BY 4 ASC, 5 DESC
